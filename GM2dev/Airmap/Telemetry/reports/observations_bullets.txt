Bullet observations for Descriptive Analytics based on the whole population (2020)
# Date: 27/11/2020

- Total amount of observations = 315.114
    - Number of .tsv files = 3041
        - Note: A recursive script had to be created to consolidate each file into a unique and global dataset
        - Note: Some of the .tsv could not be retrieved from original directory (FIXME)

- Variables: 
    - Original set = 27
    - Non-empty variables = 21
    - Final set = 29
        - Note: variables "observed" and "received" were displayed in scientific format. After setting that format
            to "FALSE", it was shown that the variables were expressed in EPOCH TIME, but the last 3 digits were
            redundant, and had to be extracted from the original value.
        - Note: More variables were created based on "observed":
            - date
            - time
            - year
            - month
            - day
            - hour
            - minute
            - second

        - Missing values:
            - "pressure_hectopascals": 312399 values are NULL
            - "velocity_y_meters_per_second": 224527 values are NULL
            - "velocity_x_meters_per_second": 224436 values are NULL
            - "velocity_z_meters_per_second": 224417 values are NULL
            - "altitude_reference": 189630 values are NULL
            - "altitude_meters": 189588 values are NULL
            - "vertical_speed_meters_per_second": 187159 values are NULL
            - "yaw_degrees": 162567 values are NULL
            - "pitch_degrees": 162445 values are NULL
            - "roll_degrees": 162417 values are NULL
            - "ground_speed_meters_per_second": 39487 values are NULL
            - "course_degree": 39487 values are NULL

        - Frequencies:

        - Particular observations:
            - "altitude meters":
                - range: from -12 mts to 2022.333 mts
                - mean: 53,59 mts
                - the variable counts 3111 negative numbers. Does it make sense?
                - 56% of the values are 0.

            - "latitude_degrees":
                - range: from -40.76861 to 85

            - "altitude reference":
                - there are only 2 labels in the dataset

            - "source id":
                - there is only 1 label1 in the dataset: "udp"

            - "track_id":
                - unique values: 476 (could represent total number of flights?)

    - External sources:
        - A weather source could be added to complement "pressure_hectopascals"


    - Applications for the global dataset:
        - NA analysis
        - Outlier detection
        - Correlation Analysis
        - Principal Component Analysis
        - Mapping


    - Questions to responde:
        - Quantity of flights per hour, day and month.
        - Length of trajectories:
            - Analytic: calculate distance between beginning and ending point of each travel
            - Graphic: render the trajetories over a region map

        - Is there any use for the yaw, pitch and roll??
